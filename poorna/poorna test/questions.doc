    emp =e;
    e=a;
    a=empconsole.log("inside pass by value function=>a=$[a] e=$[e]");
}
passed by referemce--In this pass by reference function is called by directly passes the reference address of the variable as an argument so if we change the original value too
syntax--
function passbyReference(obj){
  let emp =obj.a;
  obj.a = obj.b;
  obj.b = temp;
  console.log("inside pass by reference function=>a=$[onj.a] b=$[obj.b]");

}
passbyReference(obj)
console.log("calling pass by reference function =>a=$[onj.a] b=$[obj.b]")
