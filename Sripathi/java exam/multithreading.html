    <h3>what is thread</h3>
    <p>A Thread is a very light-weighted process, or we can say the smallest part of the process that allows a program to operate more efficiently by running multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>
    <p>In order to perform complicated tasks in the background, we used the Thread concept in Java. All the tasks are executed without affecting the main program. In a program or process, all the threads have their own separate path for execution, so each thread of a process is independent.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>multi Threading in java </h3>
    <p>Multithreading  that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.</p>
    <h3>Threads can be created by using two mechanisms</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Extending the Thread class </li>
        <p>We create a class that extends the java.lang.Thread class. This class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class. A thread begins its life inside run() method. We create an object of our new class and call start() method to start the execution of a thread. Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object.</p>
        <li> implementing the Runnable Interface</li>
        <p>We create a new class which implements java.lang.Runnable interface and override run() method. Then we instantiate a Thread object and call start() method on this object. </p>
    </ol>
