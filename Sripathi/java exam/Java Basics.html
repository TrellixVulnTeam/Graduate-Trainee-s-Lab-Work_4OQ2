    <h3>a)What is Java? </h3>
    <p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. 
    It is a computing platform for application development. 
    Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. 
    It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.</p>

    <h3>What is Features Of core Java?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Simple</li>
        <li>Object-oriented</li>
        <li>Platform-independent</li>
        <li>Portable</li>
        <li>Robust</li>
        <li>Secure</li>
        <li> Multithreaded and Interactive</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Explain the Architecture of JVM</h3>
    <p>JVM contains classloader, memory area, execution engine etc.</p>
    <h4>1)Classloader</h4>
    <p>Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Bootstrap ClassLoader</li>
        <li>Extension ClassLoader</li>
        <li>System/Application ClassLoader</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2)Mermory Areas Allocated By JVM</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Class Area</li>
        <li>Heap</li>
        <li>Stack</li>
        <li> Program Counter Register</li>
        <li>Native Method Stack</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4)Execution Engine it contain</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A virtual processor</li>
        <li>Interpreter</li>
        <li>Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5)Java Native Interface</h3>
    <p>Java Native Interface (JNI) is a framework which provides an interface to communicate with another application written in another language like C, C++, Assembly etc. Java uses JNI framework to send output to the Console or interact with OS libraries.</p>

    <h3>c)What is Difference Between Jdk,Jre,Jvm</h3>

    <h3>JDK</h3>
    <p>Java Development Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute a Java program. 
    JDK includes development tools to provide an environment to develop Java programs.</p>
    <p>It contains JRE that runs your Java code. JDK contains other resources like the interpreter/loader, compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), and a documentation generator (Javadoc). These components together help you to build Java programs.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3>JRE</h3>
    <p>JRE is a collection of tools that allow the development of applications and provide a runtime environment to run Java programs. JVM is a part of JRE. JRE is also platform-dependent.</p>
    <p>JRE facilitates the execution of Java programs and comprises JVM, Runtime class libraries, User interface toolkits, Deployment technologies, Java plugin, etc.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3>JVM</h3>
    <p>Java Virtual Machine(JVM) provides a runtime environment in which bytecode executes. Java Virtual Machine is platform-dependent. The JVM performs the following tasks:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Loading the code</li>
        <li>Verifying the code</li>
        <li>Executing the code</li>
        <li>Providing a runtime environment</li>
    </ol>
