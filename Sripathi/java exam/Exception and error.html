    <h3>b)exception Handling</h3>
    <p>an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.</p>
    <p>an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.</p>
    <p>The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>statement 1;</li>
        <li>statement 2;</li>
        <li>statement 3;</li>
        <li>statement 4;</li>
        <li>statement 5;//exception occurs  </li>
        <li>statement 6;</li>
        <li>statement 7;</li>
        <li>statement 8;</li>
        <li>statement 9;</li>
        <li>statement 10;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Suppose there are 10 statements in a Java program and an exception occurs at statement 5; the rest of the code will not be executed, i.e., statements 6 to 10 will not be executed. However, when we perform exception handling, the rest of the statements will be executed. That is why we use exception handling in Java.</p>

    <h3>Error</h3>

    <p>Error is an illegal operation performed by the user which results in the abnormal working of the program. Programming errors often remain undetected until the program is compiled or executed. Some of the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. Thus errors should be removed before compiling and executing. </p>

    <h3>Hierarchy of Java Exception classes</h3>
    <p>The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception hierarchy inherited by two subclasses: Exception and Error. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Throwable</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Exception</li>
            <ol>
                <li>ioeException</li>
                <li>sqlException</li>
                <li>classnot found exception</li>
                <li>RunTime Exception</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arithmetic Exception</li>
                    <li>NullpointerException</li>
                    <li>Numberformate exception</li>
                    <li>indexoutof bound Exception</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>arrayindexoutof bounds exception</li>
                        <li>stringindexoutof exception</li>
                    </ol>

                </ul>

    <h3>Java Exception Keywords </h3>

    <h3>Try</h3>
    <p>The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally.</p>

     <h3>catch</h3>
     <p>The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later.</p>

     <h3>finally</h3>
     <p>The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.</p>

     <h3>throw</h3>
     <p>The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception</p>

     <h3>throws</h3> 
     <p>The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used with method signature.</p>
