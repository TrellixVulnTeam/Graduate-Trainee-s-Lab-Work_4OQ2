    <h3>Building blocks of Angular</h3>

    <p>The main building blocks for Angular are modules, components, templates, metadata, data binding, directives, services, and dependency injection. We will be looking at it in a while.
        Angular does not have a concept of “scope” or controllers instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its main architectural concept.</p>
