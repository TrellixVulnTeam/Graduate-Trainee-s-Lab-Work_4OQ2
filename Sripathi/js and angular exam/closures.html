    <h3>closers:-</h3>
    <p>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) 
        with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
         In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
         In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function</p>

         <h4>accessing variables of function even its execution completes or out of its scope</h4>


    <script>

        //accessing variables of function even its execution completes or out of its scope

        function outer(){
            var x = 10;

            function inner(){
                var y = 100
                console.log(x)
            }
            return inner
        }
        

        var res = outer()

        res()


    </script>
