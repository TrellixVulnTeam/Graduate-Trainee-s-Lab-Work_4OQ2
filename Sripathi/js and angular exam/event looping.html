    <h3>Event Looping</h3>
    <p>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. 
    When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running.
    Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed</p>
