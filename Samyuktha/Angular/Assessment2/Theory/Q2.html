2.Explain about shallow copy and deep copy.
Shallow copy:An Object can be considered as Shallow Copied when a separate copy of top-level value type properties is assigned
to the new Object and the properties that  will represent an object are copied by reference to the destination folder.
Example:
class Shallow  
{   
int x = 30;  
}  
public class ShallowCopyExample   
{      
public static void main(String argvs[])   
{  
Shallow obj1 = new Shallow();  
Shallow obj2 = obj1;  
obj2.x = 6;  
System.out.println("The value of x is: " + obj1.x);  
}  
}   

Deep copy:When we do a copy of some entity to create two or more than two entities such that changes in one entity are not
reflected in the other entities, then we can say we have done a deep copy. In the deep copy a new memory allocation happens
for the other entities, and reference is not copied to the other entities.Each entity has its own independent reference. 
Example:
class DeepCopy  
{    
int x = 30;  
}  
public class DeepCopyExample   
{       
public static void main(String argvs[])   
{    
DeepCopy obj1 = new DeepCopy();  
DeepCopy obj2 = new DeepCopy();  
obj2.x = 6;     
System.out.println("The value of x is: " + obj1.x);  
}  
}
