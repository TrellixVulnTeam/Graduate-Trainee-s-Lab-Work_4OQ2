1.Explain about closures with example in javascript.
In JavaScript, a closure is a function that references variables in outer scope from its inner scope.
A closure is a function that preserves the outer scope in its inner scope.
Example:
function calculate(x) {
    function multiply(y) {
        return x * y;
    }
    return multiply;
}
const multiply3 = calculate(3);
const multiply4 = calculate(4);

console.log(multiply3); 
console.log(multiply3());

console.log(multiply3(6)); 
console.log(multiply4(2));
