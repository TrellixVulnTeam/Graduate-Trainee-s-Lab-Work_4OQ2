6.Explain about event looping in javascript
An event looping is a programming construct that allows for asynchronous programming and can be used to improve
the performance of an application.The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations.
When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will
again check for any other tasks that need to be performed. 
Example:
const lunch = () => console.log("It's time for lunch!");

const dinner = () => console.log("It's time for dinner!");

const breakfast = () => {
  console.log("Time to breakfast!");
  setTimeout(lunch, 3000);
  dinner();
};

breakfast();
