10.Explain about different data bindings in angular.
Data bindings are used to define the communication between a component and the DOM. It is a technique to link the data to the view layer.
data binding is a communication between your typescript code of component and template which user sees.It makes easy to define interactive 
applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data.
Data binding divided into different types:
1.one-way data binding - model to view 
2.two-way data binding-  model to view and view to model
3.Property binding- model to view
4.Event binding- view to model
5.Attribute binding- model to view

1.One-way data binding:One way databinding is a simple one way communication where HTML template is changed when we make
changes in TypeScript code.
2.Property Binding: Property binding is also a one-way data binding technique. In property binding, we bind a property of 
a DOM element to a field which is a defined property in our component TypeScript code.
3.two-way : In two way data binding, property binding and event binding are combined together.
4.Event binding: event binding is used to handle the events raised from the DOM like button click, mouse move.
