7.Explain about building blocks of an angular application.
Building blocks of Angular like components, directives, modules, services, component templates ,data binding ,metadata,
dependency injection.
Modules are aimed for modularity and denoted by @NgModule.
Components are denoted by @Component.Components have .js,
.html and .css files.metadata has templates ,styles and selector.
Databinding has 1.one-way data binding - model to view 
2.two-way data binding-  model to view and view to model 3.Property binding- model to view 4.Event binding- view to model
5.Attribute binding- model to view.
A directive in Angular is a .js/.ts class, which is declared with @Directive.It has components,
Attribute directives,structral directives.
Services Declared as @Injectable. A class that gives us the ability to use data in multiple components. It provides specific functionality 
not directly related to views and saves us from duplicated code.
Dependency injection is inserting the service in the components in constructor.
