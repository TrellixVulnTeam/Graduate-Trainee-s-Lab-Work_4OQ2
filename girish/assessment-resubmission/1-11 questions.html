question 1.what is a call back function and call back hell in java script?
Ans:
call back function is executed after one function is executed .

const message = function() {  
    console.log("This message is shown after 3 seconds");
}
 
setTimeout(message, 3000);
the “message” function is being called after 3 seconds have passed.


call back:
The situation where callbacks are nested within other callbacks in pyramidal order, potentially making it difficult to understand and maintain the code.
let words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
  
const animateAll = (animate) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        animate(words[0]);
        setTimeout(() => {
            animate(words[1]);
            setTimeout(() => {
                animate(words[2]);
            }, 1000)
        }, 1000)
    }, 1000)
}



<Question:2 -iterate an object in java script?>
ans:
Object.keys(obj).forEach((k, i) => {
    if (i >= 100 && i < 300) {
        console.log(obj[k]);
    }
});
we use iteration to perform a loop for certain amount of times until the out is acheived.



<Question:3explain about promises and create a custom promisewith example?>
ans:
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value
The promise object returned by the new Promise constructor has these internal properties:

state — initially "pending", then changes to either fulfilled when resolve is called or rejected when reject is called.
result — initially undefined, then changes to value when resolve(value) is called or error when reject(error) is called.

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000);
  });
  
  // resolve runs the first function in .then
  promise.then(
    result => alert(result), // shows "done!" after 1 second
    error => alert(error) // doesn't run
  );


  <Question:4:type conversion in java script?>
    ans:
    type conversion is defined as transforming data from one data type to other data type.
    <p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
Number("3.14") + "<br>" +
Number(Math.PI) + "<br>" +
Number("    ") + "<br>" +
Number("") + "<br>" +
Number("99 88") + "<br>" +
Number("John") + "<br>";
</script>

</body>
this converts variable to number data type.




Question:5 :passed by value and passed by reference in java script?
ans:
In pass by value in JavaScript, a copy of the original variable is created so any changes made to the copied variable do not affect the original variable.

In pass by reference in JavaScript, we pass the reference of the actual parameter. No copy is created in the memory.
tmp = b;
b = a;
a = tmp;
console.log(`Inside Pass by value 
    function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
}

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
console.log(`Before calling Pass by value 
    Function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);

Passbyvalue(a, b);

console.log(`After calling Pass by value 
   Function -> a =${a} b = ${b}`);


   Question:6:
   ans:
   flex :it is used in creating responsive styling for html documents.
   example.
   display:flex;
   flex direction:justify



   grid:basically grid is used to produce the elelments in rows and columns order


   display:grid;


   Question:7:currying?
   evaluating functions with multiple arguments and decomposing them into a sequence of functions with a single argument


   const addCurry =(a) => {
    return (b)=>{
        return (c)=>{
            return a+b+c
        }
    }
}
console.log(addCurry(2)(3)(5)) // 10




Question:8:
object-prototype:
every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property is not visible. Every function includes prototype object by default.
example: 
const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");


Question:9:access data from ine js file to another?
ans:In JavaScript, variables can be accessed from another file using the   import or export statement
example:
var Student = {
	name : "ABC",
	age : 18,
	dept : "CSE",
	score : 90
};
module.exports = {Student};



Question:9_java script and type script?


JavaScript is a scripting language which helps you create interactive web pages whereas Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.
Typescript code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code doesnt need to compile.
Comparing TypeScript and JS, Typescript supports a feature of prototyping while JavaScript doesnt support this feature.
Typescript uses concepts like types and interfaces to describe data being used whereas JavaScript has no such concept.
Typescript is a powerful type system, including generics & JS features for large size project whereas JavaScript is an ideal option for small size project.
