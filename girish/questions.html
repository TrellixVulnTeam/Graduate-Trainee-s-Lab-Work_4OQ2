        <Question:2->iteration in java script?
        Answer:iteration can be done by "for" loop condition for an object,for example
        for(i=0;i<3;i++) 
        something based on the requirement the loop continues until the output is achieved.



        Question:3 ->promises in java script?
         Answer:Promises are basically of three types 
        1. resolve
        2. reject
        3. always
        *Resolve -this condition executes when the output is ssuccesfully compiled.
        *reject  - this is executed when the output is not compiled and produce errors.
        *always  -this condition is executed all the times 
        sample:
        let a="20";
        let b="50";
        let c="a/b";
        resolve(){
            console.log("this is executed");

        }
        reject(){
            console.log("5")
        }
        finally(){
            console.log("always executed");
        }
        ->In this case the output would be "5" and "always executed".
        let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject) =>{
            a = 20;
            b = 4;
            c = a/b;
            if(a>b)
            resolve(c);
            else 
            reject("invalid output");
        });
            promise 
            .then(data =>console.log(data))
            .catch(reason=> console.log(reason))
            .finally(() => console.log("always executes"))
             let result = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments')
             .then(response => response.json())
             .then(json  => console.log(json))
             .catch(reason => console.log(reason))






       * <Question:6 ->difference between flex and grid?
       Answer:
      -> In grid css  the entire view changes in the format of rows and columns i.e in the grid view.we can use the css in style tag

       example:display:grid;
        
      ->In flex css, basically it is used for responsiveness of an apllication or web page .It provides space for entire div tag , and when we remove the div the div tag it eliminates the entire DOM elements spac.
      for example:

      display:flex;
      flex-direction:justify;(this helps us to adjust the directions.)



      <Question:9 ->difference between java script and type script 
        Answer:
        *type script : Basically type is very much typed script unlike java script
        *we should definitely mention the data type when we decalre a variable.
        *type script also accepts all the Javascript files to compile
         
        Javascript:
        *java script supports node js libraries.
        *java script is loosely typed comapred to type script.
         *in Javascript it is not mandatory to declare data type for a variable . 



         <Question:5 -> pass by value and pass by refernce?
            Answer:
            *pass by value->
            basically pass by value  does not depend on the variable we passed inside the function ,
            even if we change the initial value , the output would be the first assigned value.
            for example:
            var a="4";
            let change = (val) => {
                val = 9
             }
             change(a);
             document.write(a);
             now the output will be "4" only .
             *pass by refernce->
             firstly, it depends on the outer function changes , outer functions defiitely change the output of the the entire variable 
             that is decalred outside or inside the function
             for example:
             var a={num:1};
             let change= value=>{
                var.num=89;

             }
             cahnge(a);
             console.log(a);
             the output cahnges the value of a from "1" to "89".

             <Question:10:->Access data from one script to another ?
                Answer:
                basically we use export and import statements to access the data from one script to another 
                 
                export statment can be used ,
                for accessing the data from another script block i.e methods classes or any variables too, 
                by calling its name

                for example:
                export{}

                import statment can be used for importing the entire file by using its path location
                for example ;
                import(../components/src/hello.js)
                this is how we import the blocks directly in to other script block.




                <Question :1-> call back function and call back hell?
                    Answer:
                    a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution
                    for example
                    setTimeout(greet, 2000);
                    sayName('John');
                    it will execute after 2 seconds.



                    <question :8-> reverse string 
                        Answer:
                        the main goal is to obtain the reverse form of any string that has been asked by the user
                        for example:
                        const string = prompt('Enter a string: ');

                         const result = reverseString(string);
                          console.log(result);
                          the output will be reverse of what the user enters in the prompt box.



                          object prototype:
                        
	function Student() {
		this.name = 'girish';
		this.gender = 'Male';
	}

	Student.prototype.age = 15;

	var studObj1 = new Student();
	alert(studObj1.age); 

	var studObj2 = new Student();
	alert(studObj2.age); 

    Age="15" for student object2.
	
     the answer is if we want to add any extra feature to the existing object the possible way is by using prototype.
     it will automatically reflect to the other object.  


     <Question:4-> type conversion?
        Answer: 
        converrting one data type to another data type is called as type conversion.
        for example:
        The Number() method converts a variable (or value) into a number:
        same asstring () method converts  a variable (or value) into a string:
        for example :
        x.toString()
        (123).toString()
       (100 + 23).toString()
