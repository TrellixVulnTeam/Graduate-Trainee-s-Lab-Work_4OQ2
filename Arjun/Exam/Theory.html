    <h1> Question 1</h1> <br>

    <p> Callback Function : A callback is passed as an argument to another function that executes the callback
        based on the result. They are basically functions that are executed only after a result.

        <br>
        <br>

        Callback Hell : A Callback hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid
        structure. Every
        callback depends on the previous callback.

    <h1> Question 4</h1> <br>
    <br>
    <p>Type conversion transfers the data from one data type to another. </p>
    <hr>

    <h1> Question 5</h1> <br>
    <br>
    <p>In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as an argument. So any changes
        made inside the function does not affect the original value.</p> <br>
    <p>In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as an
        argument. So changing the value inside the function also change the original value</p>

    <h1> Question 6</h1> <br>

    <p>Flexbox:

        Flexbox is a 1 dimensional system, that means, it can handle only rows.
        Example
        Header
        The main motive is to change width and height to fill the available space
        and its more focus is on content than layout
        it is used for small scale.<br>
        <br>

        CSS Grid:

        CSS Grid is a 2 dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows
        Example :
        Body,
        Footer.

        It allows us to align components into columns and rows.

        It is mainly focused on layout other than content,

        grid is used for large scale where there is no linear display
    </p>

    <h1> Question 8</h1> <br>

    <p>All javaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
        Prototype Inheritance,
        Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
        Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
        Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
        The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

        Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.</p>

    <h1> Question 9</h1> <br>

    <p>TypeScript is known as an Object-oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a prototype based
        language.<br>
        TypeScript supports Interfaces but JavaScript does not.<br>
        TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code, TypeScript code cant be interpreted by
        browsers. So if the code was written in TypeScript, it gets compiled and converted into JavaScript, With the
        help
        of JavaScript code, browsers are able to read the code and display it.</p>

    <h1>Question 10</h1>

    <p>JavaScript file is imported using the src attribute of script tag within the “head” section of the HTML file.
        Since the JavaScript file is imported, the contents are accessible within the HTML file.</p>
