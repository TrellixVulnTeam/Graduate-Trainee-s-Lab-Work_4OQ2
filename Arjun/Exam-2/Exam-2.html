Question-1

It is a Function which returns another function and that function is going to be a inner function of the outside
function.
Outside function is ging to return the inner function.
Inside function is going to access the variables of outside function.
Inner function maintains the state between successive function calls.
Closures are used to create stand alone isolated entities.
Example:
Function outerfunction(a)
{
Let a=100;
Return function innerfunction (b)
{
Let b=200;
Return a+b;
}
Console.log(outer function(100)(200));

Question-2

Shallow copy:
Shallow copy is a bit wise copy of an object, a new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the
original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects then the reference address are
copied

Example:
Var employee = {
Eid : ”102”
Ename : “Arjun”
Eaddress : “Hyderabad”
}
Console.log(“Employee=>”,employee);
Var newEmployee = employee;
Console.log(“newEmployee=>”,newEmployee);
newEmployee.ename = “Chandra”;
Console.log(“Employee=>”,employee);
Console.log(“newEmployee=>”,newEmployee);

Deep copy:
A deep copy copies all the fields and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy
occurs when an object is copied along with the objects it refers to.

Example:

Let copiedobj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(empobj));
console.log(empobj);
console.log(copiedobj);
copiedobj.firstName = “Arjun”;
console.log(empobj);
console.log(copiedobj);


Question-3
Object destructuring is used for extracting values from an object property and assigning them to another variable.
The Object destructuring is also possible for Arrays.

Example:
Let empObj = {
firstName : “Arjun”
lastName : “Chandra”
};
Let { firstName : fName, lastName : lName } = empObj;
Console.log(fName);
Console.log(lName);

Question-4

Arrow function reduces lots of code and makes the code more readable.
Arrow function syntax automatically binds “this” to the surrounding code.
Writing the arrow => is more flexible as compared with the writing function keyword.
Example:
Let checkNumber =(num) => num > 10?
Console.log(“yes”) : console.log(“no”);
checkNumber (5);

Question-5

A Higher order function is a function that receives a function as an argument and returns the function as output.

Example:
Function calculate (numbers)
{
Let sum = 0;
For (const number of numbers)
Sum = sum + number;
{
Return sum ;
}
Calculate (1,2,3);

Question-6
When a function is waiting in stack memory and in the heap memory is connected to stack memory and it is connected to
event queue and in that the function is awaiting


Question-7
Building blocks of an Angular are
Modules, Components, Templates, Metadata, Data binding, Directives, Services, Dependency Injection

Question-8
Advantages of using Angular:
It is used in large scale and used to build single page applications.
Code is more understandable.
It helps to deal with pagination, formatting and reversing a text
Angular contains lot of different solutions such as routing modules etc
Angular allows to write and test module code separately from the rest of an app, as a result, only some parts of apps
and services will be tested.
Dependency injection will help us manage back end and web apps become more faster and stable.
Angular makes it easier to build large and complex applications .
It is an open source
It has two way data binding between model and views or html.

Question-9

A single page application is an application that allows us to work inside a browser and does not require reloading the
page.
Single page application continuously interacts with the user by rewriting the current page rather than loading entire
new page from server.
Advantages:
It is fast and responsive
It has high performance and stability
It is mobile friendly
Pass information to a component using a parameter.


Question-10

Data binding is the mechanism that binds the application user interface to modules, using data binding, user will be
able to manipulate the elements present on the website.
Types of data binding:
One way data binding  in one way data binding, data flows only in one direction that is from models to views.
One way data binding is of 3 types Interpolation, property binding and event binding.
Two way data binding  in two way data binding, it will allow to share data in two directions that is from component to
template and from template to component.
