    1Q:Explain about closures with example in javascript?
    Ans:a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
    In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

    Ex:
    <script>

        function outerFunction(a) {
            //let a = 100;
            return function innerFunction(b) {
                //let b = 200;
                return function subFunction(c) {
                    return a + b + c;
                }
            }
        }
        // let fun = outerFunction(100);
        // console.log(fun(200));

        console.log(outerFunction(100)(200)(300));   

        let fun = outerFunction(100);
        let fun2 = fun(200);
        console.log(fun2(300));


    </script>

    2Q:Explain about shallow copy and deep copy?
    Ans:Shallow copy:When a reference variable is copied into a new reference variable using the assignment operator a shallow copy of the referenced object is created. 
    A reference variable mainly stores the address of the object it refers to. 
    When a new reference variable is assigned the value of the old reference variable the address stored in the old reference variable is copied into the new one. 
    This means both the old and new reference variable point to the same object in memory. 
    As a result if the state of the object changes through any of the reference variables it is reflected for both.

    Ex:
    const empObj = {
        firstName:'Mounika',
        lastName:'Boinapally',
       getFullName:function() {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        },
        address: {
            cityName: 'Hyderabad'
        }
    };
    


   let copiedObj = empObj;
    console.log(empObj);
    console.log(copiedObj);
    copiedObj.firstname = "Hira";
    console.log(empObj);
    console.log(copiedObj);


    let copiedObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(empObj));
    console.log(empObj);
    console.log(copiedObj);
    copiedObj.firstname="Hira";
    console.log(empObj);
    console.log(copiedObj);


   let copiedObj=Object.assign({},empObj);
    console.log(empObj);
    console.log(copiedObj);
    copiedObj.firstname="Hira";
    copiedObj.address.cityName = "Mumbai";
    console.log(empObj);
    console.log(copiedObj);


    Deep copy:deep copy makes a copy of all the members of the old object, allocates separate memory location for the new object and then assigns the copied members to the new object. 
    In this way, both the objects are independent of each other and in case of any modification to either one the other is not affected.

    Ex:

        let copiedObj = {
            ...empObj,
            address: { ...empObj.address }
        };
        console.log(empObj);
        console.log(copiedObj);
        copiedObj.firstName = "Hira";
        copiedObj.address.cityName = "Mumbai";
        console.log(empObj);
        console.log(copiedObj);
        

        3Q:Explain about destructing of an object in javascript?
        Ans:Destructuring is a javascript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays,objects and set them into new different variables.
        Object destructuring is used for extracting values from an object property and assigning them to another variable.
        The Object destructuring is also possible for Arrays.
        

        Ex:
        let empObj = {
            firstName: "Mounika",
            LastName: "Boinapally"
        };

        let { firstName: fName, LastName: lName } = empObj;
        console.log(fName);
        console.log(lName);


        4Q:What are the advantages of using arrow functions and give an example?
        Ans:This arrow function reduces lots of code and makes the mode more readable.
        Arrow function syntax automatically binds this to the surrounding code context.
        Writing the arrow => is more flexible as compared with the writing function keyword.
        
        Ex:
        let checkNumber = (num) => num > 16;
        console.log("Yes") : console.log("No");
 
    checkNumber(5);
    checkNumber(10);
    checkNumber(20);
    checkNumber(32);


    5Q:Explain about higher order functions in javascript?
    Ans:Higher order functions in JavaScript are a special category of functions that either accept functions as an argument or return functions.

    On the other side, if the function uses only primitives or objects as arguments or return values, these functions are firstorder.
    
    Higher order functions provide the reusability.


    6Q:Explain about event looping in javascript?
    Ans:Event loop: An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty.


    7Q:Explain about building blocks of an angular application?
    Ans:Modules
    Components
    Templates
    Metadata
    Data binding
    Directives
    Services
    Dependency injection

    8Q:What are the advantages of using Angular in web app development?
    Ans:Advantages of using Angular: 
     It is used in large scale and used to build single page applications.
     Code is more understandable.
     It helps to deal with formatting and reversing a text
     Angular contains lot of different solutions such as routing modules etc
     Easy to Learn.
     It has a Two-Way Binding Feature.
     Supports SPA features.
     Has a Declarative UI.
     Supported by Google.
     Allows for Optimal Web Application Management.
     It is a Powerful Framework.
     Real-Time Testing.

    9Q:What is Single Page Application and explain about the advantages?
    Ans: A single-page application is a web app that consists of a single HTML page loads new JSON data from the server and rewrites the page in response to user actions.
    This allows for creating single-page applications that run in a browser yet have UIs and functionality similar to that of desktop apps.

    advantages:
    Fast and responsive.
    Debugging is easier
    Browsing or navigating through the website is easy.

    10Q:Explain about different data bindings in angular?
    Ans:Data Binding is the mechanism that binds the applications UI to the models. 
    Using Data Binding, the user will be able to manipulate the elements present on the website using the browser. 
    Whenever some variable has been changed that particular change must be reflected in the DOM.
    Angular allows both One way and Two way Data Binding.

    One way binding:In one-way data binding, data flows only in one direction, from the models to the views. 
    one-way data binding in Angular can be of three types, Interpolation, Property binding, and Event binding.
    
    Two way binding:Angular allows two-way data binding that will allow to share data in two directions, from the components to the templates and vice versa.
    This helps the models to always be synchronized.
